# Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements **image-based steganography** to securely hide secret messages within images. The encoded message can only be retrieved using a passcode, ensuring **confidentiality and protection** from unauthorized access.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **OpenCV** – For image processing and pixel manipulation  
- **OS Module** – To handle file operations  
- **ASCII Encoding** – For text-to-pixel conversion  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Secure Message Embedding** – Hides text in image pixels  
✅ **Passcode Protection** – Only authorized users can decrypt the message  
✅ **Minimal Image Distortion** – The image remains visually unchanged  
✅ **Lightweight & Efficient** – Fast execution with simple logic  

## 🔧 How to Use  
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies  
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install OpenCV:  
```bash
pip install opencv-python
